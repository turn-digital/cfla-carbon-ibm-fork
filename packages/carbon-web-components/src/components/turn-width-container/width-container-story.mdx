Text token $text-inverse

## Design and UX comments:

The avatar is used in the Left panel component. In the case of the expanded
panel, the avatar is placed next to the avatarText - title of the section , on
its left side. In a collapsed panel, the section title is not shown and only the
avatar is visible.
